# Resistance-Propulsion-Maneuvering
Here you will find a program for calculating resistance, propulsion and manouvering and its accompanying documentation.

In the master branch, you will find the latest version of the working code, as well as the accompanying files that are necessary to run it.

To run the code, you need to input your ship dimensions and necessary variables into the "Input" code, and after that simply run the "Program" file. The data that is entered by default is related to the "Ship A" from the "A practical Calculation Method of Ship Maneuvering Motion" by Inoue.

The program will output the most important results. If you wish to go into more detail, open files individually and there you can adjust the program to print more information by unhiding the "prints".

Currently working on:
    - The program is being expanded by adding the remaing ships from Inoues research on maneuvering so that the program accuracy can be increased. 
    - Further organising is neccesary to make the program easier to use and edit. 
    - Testing the accuracy of resistance methods checking
    - One of the resistance methods has errors (most likely due to the mistake in regression coefficients). That is being fixed
    - Graphs are being reorganized so that they are more readable.
    - Propulsion needs expending and further checking.
    - "Manuevering" part is being expended by adding the Zig-Zag maneuver.
