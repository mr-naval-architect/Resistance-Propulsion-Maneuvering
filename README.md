# Resistance-Propulsion-Maneuvering
Hello,

Here you will find a program for calculating ships resistance, propulsion and manouvering and its accompanying documentation.

To use the software, simply run the "Program.py" module. You will be asked to choose a method of parameters input. Once that is done, the program will run and output all the relevant data.

In the master branch, you will find the latest version of the working code, as well as the accompanying files that are necessary to run it.

The program will output the most important results. If you wish to go into more detail, open files individually and there you can adjust the program to print more information by unhashing the "prints".

Currently working on:
- Ability to save and load ship parameters from a text (save) file.
- Further organising is neccesary to make the program easier to use and edit. 
- Testing the accuracy of "resistance methods checking".
- SSPA resistance method has errors (most likely due to the mistake in regression coefficients). That is being fixed.
- S-60 and BSRA methods are being fixed.
- Resistance graphs are being reorganized so that they are more readable.
- More cavitation criteriums are being added beside Kellers.
- Propulsion needs expending and further checking.
- "Manuevering" part is being expended by adding the Zig-Zag maneuver.
